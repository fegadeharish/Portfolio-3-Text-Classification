This is part of academic portfolio project in which we have completed the text classification.
The dataset was found from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset
The objective is to classifiy the news into given categories. We have achieved the objective by using Naive-Bayes and SVM technique.
We wanted to compare the two techniques on text data and observe the results.
